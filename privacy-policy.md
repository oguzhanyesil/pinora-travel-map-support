Privacy Policy for Pinora Travel Map

Last updated: 21.12.2025

Pinora (“the App”) is a travel logging app that lets you add visits (country, city, dates, notes) and generate shareable recap images.

## Summary
- Pinora does **not** require an account.
- Your visits are stored **locally on your device**.
- Pinora does **not** sell your data and does **not** share data with third parties for advertising or tracking.
- Pinora uses Apple services (MapKit) to search for cities.

## Information We Collect
### 1) Data you enter
When you add a visit, you may provide:
- Country and city name
- Trip start and end dates
- Optional notes
- City coordinates (latitude/longitude) returned by Apple MapKit search

This data is stored **on-device** to power the app features (timeline, map coloring, counters).

### 2) Photos / Media Library Access
Pinora can export images (recap cards) and save them to your Photos library.

- Pinora requests **Add-Only** photo permission (to save export images).
- Pinora does **not** access your existing photos unless you grant broader permission (not required for normal use).

### 3) Network Usage
Pinora uses the internet for:
- **City search** via Apple MapKit (MKLocalSearch)

Pinora does not send your stored visit history to our servers (we do not operate backend servers for Pinora).

## Data Storage
All visit data is stored locally on your device using Apple’s local storage frameworks.  
If you delete the app, your local data is removed.

## Data Sharing
Pinora does not share your personal data with third parties for:
- Advertising
- Analytics tracking
- Data brokerage
- Profiling

Apple MapKit may process your city search queries to return results, per Apple’s services.

## Advertising
Pinora currently does **not** display third-party ads and does not use ad tracking (no ATT prompt).

## Children’s Privacy
Pinora is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## Your Choices
- You can delete visits inside the app.
- You can uninstall the app to remove all locally stored data.
- You can deny Photos permission; exports will still work for sharing, but saving to Photos may be unavailable.

## Contact
If you have questions, contact: contact@uiconic.co

## Updates
We may update this policy when the app features change. The latest version will always be available at this link.
