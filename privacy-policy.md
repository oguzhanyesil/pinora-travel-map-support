Privacy Policy for Pinora Travel Map

Last updated: 23.12.2025

Pinora (“the App”) is a travel logging app that lets you add visits (country, city, dates, notes) and generate shareable recap images.

## Summary
- Pinora does **not** require an account.
- Your visits are stored **locally on your device**.
- Pinora does **not** sell your personal data.
- Pinora displays **third-party advertisements** using Google AdMob.
- Pinora uses Apple services (MapKit) to search for cities.

## Information We Collect
### 1) Data you enter
When you add a visit, you may provide:
- Country and city name
- Trip start and end dates
- Optional notes

This data is stored **on-device** to power the app features (timeline, map coloring, counters).

This information is stored only on your device and is used to:
- Display your travel timeline
- Color visited countries on the map
- Generate statistics and recap images

### 2) Location & City Search Data
Pinora uses Apple MapKit (MKLocalSearch) to:
- Search for cities
- Retrieve map coordinates (latitude/longitude)

City search queries are processed by Apple according to Apple’s privacy policies.
Pinora does not store or reuse search queries beyond the immediate app session.

Pinora does not transmit this data to any server operated by us.

### 3) Photos / Media Library Access
Pinora can export images (recap cards) and save them to your Photos library.

- Pinora requests **Add-Only** photo permission (to save export images).
- Pinora does **not** access your existing photos unless you grant broader permission (not required for normal use).

### 4) Advertising (Google AdMob)
Pinora displays third-party advertisements provided by Google AdMob.

AdMob may collect limited device information to:
- Serve ads
- Measure ad performance
- Prevent fraud

This may include:
- Device identifiers
- IP address
- Approximate location
- App usage data related to ads

Pinora does not access, store, or control this data directly.
Advertising data is processed by Google in accordance with Google’s privacy policies.

🔹 Pinora does not use personalized ads and does not request App Tracking Transparency (ATT) permission.

## Data Storage
- All travel data is stored locally on your device.
- No cloud sync or backend server is used.
- Deleting the app removes all locally stored data.

## Data Sharing
Pinora does not share your personal data with third parties except:
- Apple (for MapKit services)
- Google AdMob (for advertising delivery)

Pinora does not:
- Sell user data
- Perform user profiling

## Children’s Privacy
Pinora is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## Your Choices
